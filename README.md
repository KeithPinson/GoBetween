# GoBetween Library (no not _that_ [Go](http://golang.org/ "The Go Programming Language"))  WIP
This library is a kind of intermediate structure to support converting between two human-readable documents.
It is similar to Pandoc Types but instead of Haskell it is written in Scala and is intended to be used as an
imported JAR, in other words a computer program.

## Build Instructions

Simply run the Gradle task:

    publishToMavenLocal

and a jar should be generated and published in your local Maven Repository.
