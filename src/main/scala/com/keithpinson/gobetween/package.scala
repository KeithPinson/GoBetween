/**
 * This library provides an intermediate structure to support converting between human readable documents.
 *
 * Like the Pandoc Types library, GoBetween facilitates conversion from and into its internal structure.
 * Unlike Pandoc, the documents that it is designed for are not well known. In fact, with the exception
 * of Markdown, all are proprietary. Pandoc is still the go-to tool for converting between common document
 * types like Word, HTML and Markdown.
